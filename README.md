#AutoGeneratePersuasivePresentation

##Design concept
Persuasive technology is a relatively recent research area which studies the impact that digital interventions can have on people's behaviour or beliefs. This project would use some persuasive technology research, combined with argumentation strategies, to produce a system that could dynamically create a collection of information to present to an audience in the form of a slide presentation on a topic, in order to claim a point, or present an argument. The project, starting from an annotated collection of material (e.g. pictures, catch phrases, snippets of information), will produce an intelligent system able, on the basis of argumentation techniques, to automatically create a "narrative", a sequence of images and phrases, that can be presented in the form of a set of slides to a user.
